### 2+ examples of things you enjoyed about or learned from this project
1. There are so many CSS styling tools that are available. Linear-gradients add a unique look to websites and are so easy to do.
2. I always enjoy seeing how individual pieces of a project can come together to make something with even more functionality. 
   I see it every semester and it still brings me joy!
### 2+ examples of things you didnâ€™t enjoy or wanted to learn from this project
1. Both SerpAPI and Zipcodebase have limited monthly usages on their free tiers. We had to be picky with our testing because of this. 
2.  Fly.io can be difficult to work with, however we did get it to run after an attempt of two. I also do not appreciate how the database counts as an instance.
### Technical Requirements
1. App runs on Flask server written in Python
2. Postgres Database used to persist data
3. REST API Integration
4. Flask login
### Stretch Features
1. (w8HUsXhFgP) Secure password encryption via `passlib sha256 encrypt`.
